# PacStudent - A Classic Game Recreation

## Overview

This project is a recreation of the classic Pac-man arcade game, built from the ground up in Unity for a game development course. All core visual assets, scripts, and game logic are original creations.

The project is structured to be clean, organized, and easy to evaluate. It features a custom editor tool to streamline scene setup and testing.

## One-Click Project Setup

To ensure all scenes are correctly configured for evaluation, please use the custom editor tool:

**Menu: `ALL DONE! -> 1. Configure All Scenes`**

This single action will prepare all demonstration scenes by creating and placing necessary game objects, assigning scripts, and setting up audio and animation components.

## Core Features

- **Multiple Scenes**: Includes scenes for an animation preview, a manually built level, a procedural gameplay demonstration, and an automatic movement showcase.
- **Original Assets**: All sprites for characters, items, and level components are original.
- **Full Animation System**: Characters have complete animation sets for all states (walking, scared, dead), managed by Animator Controllers.
- **Procedural Level Generation**: A robust level generator can create the full game map from a 2D array at runtime, including intelligent rotation of wall tiles.
- **Custom Editor Tools**: The project is managed by a central editor script that handles all scene setup and configuration for easy testing.
